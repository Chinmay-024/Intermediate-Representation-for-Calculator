The `printTree` function is responsible for generating a visualization of the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) created by the calculator compiler. It creates a DOT file that represents the tree structure and then converts it into a PNG image for display. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. **Output File Setup**:
   - It starts by opening an output file named "AST.dot" using the `ofstream` object. This file will contain the description of the AST in the DOT format, which is commonly used for graph visualization.

2. **Graph Initialization**:
   - The function writes the initial lines to the "AST.dot" file to set up the graph properties. This includes defining the graph as a directed graph (`digraph G`) and specifying that the nodes should be displayed as circles (`node [shape="circle"]`).

3. **BFS Traversal**:
   - The function uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal of the AST. It starts from the root node (this) and assigns a unique identifier (`count++`) to each node. It also pushes nodes into a queue for further traversal.

4. **Node Visualization**:
   - The function iterates through the nodes discovered during the BFS traversal. For each node, it writes a line to the "AST.dot" file to specify the node's label using the `label` attribute. The label is derived from the `val` attribute of the `Treenode`. This label represents the value or operator associated with the node.

5. **Edge Generation**:
   - The function generates edges between nodes to represent the parent-child relationships in the AST. If a node has a left child, it creates an edge from the current node to the left child. Similarly, if there is a right child, it creates an edge to the right child. This edge generation helps in visually showing the hierarchical structure of the tree.

6. **File Closing**:
   - After completing the graph description, the function closes the "AST.dot" file.

7. **Graph Visualization**:
   - The function uses system commands to generate a visual representation of the AST from the "AST.dot" file. It uses the Graphviz tool (`dot`) to convert the DOT file into a PNG image. The generated image is saved as "AST.png."

8. **Display Graph**:
   - The function uses another system command (`feh -F`) to display the generated "AST.png" image. This command opens a viewer for viewing the AST graph.

In summary, the `printTree` function performs a BFS traversal of the AST, creates a DOT file for visualization, generates edges to represent relationships between nodes, and then converts the DOT file into a PNG image for display. This visual representation can be very useful for understanding the hierarchical structure of the AST, especially for debugging and analysis of the parsing and evaluation process.
