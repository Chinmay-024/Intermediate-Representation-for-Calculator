1. Abstract Syntax Tree (AST):
   To generate the AST representation of the program, we can use the `-fdump-tree-original-raw` switch. This will produce a textual representation of the AST.

   Command:

   ```
   gcc -fdump-tree-original-raw program.c
   ```

   we will get a file with the `.original` extension. The contents of this file will show the AST representation of the program.

2. Gnu SIMPLE representation (GIMPLE):
   To generate the GIMPLE representation, we can use the `-fdump-tree-gimple-raw` switch. GIMPLE is a more human-readable form of the program.

   Command:

   ```
   gcc -fdump-tree-gimple-raw program.c
   ```

   This will produce a file with the `.gimple` extension. The contents of this file will show the GIMPLE representation of the program.

3. Control Flow Graph (CFG):
   To generate the CFG form of the GIMPLE code, we can use the `-fdump-tree-cfg-raw` switch.

   Command:

   ```
   gcc -fdump-tree-cfg-raw program.c
   ```

   This will generate a file with the `.cfg` extension. The contents of this file will show the CFG representation of the program.

4. Register Transfer Language (RTL IR):
   To generate the RTL IR of the program, we can use the `-da` switch with a specific pass number. Pass numbers depend on the specific transformation passes that are applied during compilation.

   Command:

   ```
   gcc -da program.c
   ```

   This will generate RTL files with pass numbers as part of the filename. we may need to examine these files to observe the RTL IR.

Keep in mind that the exact output and format of these representations may vary depending on the version of GCC we are using. The switches provided are based on typical usage in GCC.
