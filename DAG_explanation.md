The `printDAG` function is used to generate a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) visualization of the expressions in the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) constructed by the calculator compiler. The purpose of this function is to create a visual representation of the expressions and their relationships, making it easier to understand and analyze the structure of the parsed expressions.

Here's an explanation of how the `printDAG` function works:

1. **Data Structures**:
   - It starts by creating two main data structures:
     - `unordered_map<string, pair<int, Treenode *>> nodes`: This map stores nodes in the DAG, where the key is the current expression and the value is a pair containing an integer identifier and a pointer to the corresponding `Treenode` in the AST.
     - `queue<pair<int, Treenode *>> bfs`: This queue is used for performing a Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal of the AST.

2. **BFS Traversal**:
   - The function begins a BFS traversal of the AST. It starts from the root node of the AST (this), assigns each node a unique identifier (count++), and stores the nodes in the `nodes` map.
   - The BFS traversal continues by exploring the left and right children of each node. If they exist, these children are pushed into the BFS queue for further exploration.
   - The benefit of maintaing a map is if a expression has been evaluated we can directly put an edge to that expression node so this way we can implement DAG.

3. **Output File Setup**:
   - The function opens an output file named "DAG.dot" for writing. This file will contain the description of the DAG in the DOT format, which is commonly used for graph visualization.

4. **Graph Initialization**:
   - The function writes the initial lines to the "DAG.dot" file to set up the graph properties. This includes defining the graph as a directed graph (`digraph G`) and specifying that the nodes should be displayed as circles (`node [shape="circle"]`).

5. **Node Visualization**:
   - The function iterates through the nodes discovered during the BFS traversal. For each node, it writes a line to the "DAG.dot" file to specify the node's label, using the `label` attribute. The label is derived from the `val` attribute of the `Treenode`.

6. **Edge Generation**:
   - The function generates edges between nodes to represent the relationships between expressions. For each node, it checks if there are left and right children. If they exist, it creates edges from the current node to its children, signifying how expressions are connected.

7. **Avoiding Duplicates**:
   - The function uses a `vis` (visited) set to ensure that it does not generate duplicate edges between nodes. It checks whether a node has already been visited and, if not, adds it to the `vis` set and continues exploring its children.

8. **File Closing**:
   - The function closes the "DAG.dot" file after completing the graph description.

9. **Graph Visualization**:
   - The function then uses system commands to generate a visual representation of the DAG from the "DAG.dot" file. It uses the Graphviz tool (`dot`) to convert the DOT file into a PNG image. The generated image is saved as "DAG.png."

10. **Display Graph**:
    - The function uses another system command (`feh -F`) to display the generated "DAG.png" image. This command opens a viewer for viewing the graph.

In summary, the `printDAG` function traverses the AST, creates a DAG representation of the expressions and their relationships, generates a DOT file for visualization, and then converts it into a PNG image for display. This visual representation can be very useful for understanding the structure of complex expressions and their dependencies.
